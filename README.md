# hello-world
The global timeless project to greet the earth.

This should do what it says on the tin, so "Hi".

About me:
I'm a chap who likes stats and most things data. I started off with SAS for job-related reasons but now I oscillate between python and R.

I like both kinds of music, brew with a V60, and tinker with a Raspberry Pi in my spare time.
